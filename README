***** NOTE ADDED MAY 2011 *****
Siphon is a passive network mapping tool. It maps out computers on the local network by 
monitoring traffic. It identifies all of the used ports, the frequency in which they are
used and also can detect the operating systems by finding signatures in the network
traffic. This was a very cool tool at the time. I am releasing it on github just for
historical and reference purposes.
